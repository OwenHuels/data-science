The difference between them is that ints are only integers, while floats can have decimal places. Floats also take up a set amount of memory space, while ints can change the amount of space they take up. Floats are good for small numbers close to zero, while integers are good for larger numbers. Floats become less accurate as you get farther away from zero."
