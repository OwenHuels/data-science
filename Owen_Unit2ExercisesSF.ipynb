        "In this example, there is a defined spectrum of probabilities for what our set of marbles could like like (WWWW, RWWW, RRWW, RRRW, RRRR). In contrast, Wembanyama's true free throw percentage could be any real number from 0 to 1, not just one of 5 possibilities. In other words, the marbles are discrete, while a FT% is continuous. Continuous data is significantly harder to calculate by hand, and it's also harder to come up with a prior that is satisfying and reasonable than it is for discrete data. These examples are similar in that both have a binary outcome for a singular event, that being red or white and make or miss."
